            Woo-hoo! You get to do some coding! Exciting!
            **Time to complete:** 1-2 hours. It may take you less time than that if you've absorbed the material in this module well.
            **Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!**
            **Don't get scared by the number of points below. It's really not so much. I just wanted to explain everything as clearly as I could and break it down into smaller steps.**
            Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:

            1. (If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.
            2. (If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.
            3. Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, `module2-solution` or `mod2_solution`, etc. Create an `index.html` file inside the solution container folder, e.g., `module2-solution/index.html`.
            4. The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.
            5. Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a `css` folder under the solution container folder, e.g., `module2-solution/css`.
