          Coursera course: [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)
          Woo-hoo! You get to do some coding! Exciting!
          **Time to complete:** 1-2 hours. It may take you less time than that if you've absorbed the material in this module well.
          **Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!**
          **Don't get scared by the number of points below. It's really not so much. I just wanted to explain everything as clearly as I could and break it down into smaller steps.**
          Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:

        <h2>  2 Assignment Coding Module</h2>
                1. (If you haven't already) Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.
          2. (If you haven't already) Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on how to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.
          3. Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example, `module2-solution` or `mod2_solution`, etc. Create an `index.html` file inside the solution container folder, e.g., `module2-solution/index.html`.
          4. The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop, tablet, and mobile. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single, responsive page.
          5. Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your CSS file should be placed into a `css` folder under the solution container folder, e.g., `module2-solution/css`.
          6. You are NOT allowed to use any CSS (or Javascript) framework for this assignment, including Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework. No framework CSS files should even be referenced in your index.html, even if you are not using them. **However, you MAY use the simple responsive framework we developed in Lecture 24 as a starting point for this assignment.**
          7. You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.
          8. Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 divs (all in one row in the desktop view). Each div contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the divs are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (_Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23._)

        Here is the mockup illustration of the tablet version of the site. Your final result should look very close to this mockup. Note that in this view, the 3rd div takes up the entire row.

        Here is the mockup illustration of the mobile version of the site. Your final result should look very close to this mockup.
